        PLANETOID.

This is the Acornsoft BBC Micro version of Defender.
A repository for me to reverse the code, somewhat, to understand the Beeb a lot better. This version was built by Visual Studio Code, using, BeebAsm and Kick Assembler. You will need to edit the json file's paths, in the .VSCode folder, to your executables - Beebasm.exe and the Kickass jar file.

I thank the orignal reverse engineer for the labels and constants used throughout. A few errors seem to appear in the orignal labels/constants and in the source code he used as well. They are noted in the Planetoid.beebasm.txt file, with a FIND aid, if you search for 'diff.'

Planet2.asm is the main file.
