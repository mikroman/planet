PLANETOID. This is the Acornsoft BBC Micro version of Defender.
A repository for me to reverse the code, somewhat, to understand the Beeb a lot better.
This version was built by Visual Studio Code, using, BeebAsm and Kick Assembler.
You will need to edit the json file's paths, in the .VSCode folder, to your executables - Beebasm.exe and the Kickass jar file.
Planet2.asm is the main file.
Also see this version.
